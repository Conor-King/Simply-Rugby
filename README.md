# Simply-Rugby
Application made for the graded unit.

Simply Rugby is an application for coaches to use to help organise players and squads for their sport. It allows the Coach to view their players and squads, search for players, view information on selected players, add and edit skills on the players profile, remove skills from the player and create new skills to use for the players.

## Login Screen

The login screen has a very simplistic look and represents a top to bottom feel. The user will flow from the top of the window by reading the title. Then entering their username and password, until finally clicking the login button at the bottom of the page.

If the user inputs an invalid username or password, they will receive an error message dialog.



## Menu Screen

The menu screen will be the first screen shown once the user has logged into the system. Under the title on the screen will be the name of the coach that is currently logged in. This will act as feedback for the user, so they know they have successfully logged into the system. Following the simplistic style that will be presented throughout the application.

The navigation for the application will be 4 buttons evenly spaced with a good size for ease of click and readability. The user will be able to navigate to: Player list screen, Squad list screen, Create a skill screen, and back to the login screen by the logout button.
Selecting the red X button from the menu screen will dispose of the menu screen and display the login screen. Logging out the user.

## Create A Skill Screen

The create a skill screen will allow the user to add a new skill to the system. Keeping the application consistent I decided to keep the top to bottom feel when creating this screen. With the flow of the window the user will choose a skill category their skill fits into. Then input the name of the skill, adding a description, until finally selecting the add button which will add the new skill to the system.

## Player List Screen

The player list screen will show the user all the players registered on the system. Keeping with the theme of the application sticking with the top to bottom feel. The user has the ability to search through the players in the system to find a specific player or look through the full list. The user will be able to enter the name or part of the name of the player into the text box. Then by clicking the search button it will display the results below.

## Squad List Screen

The squad list screen will show the user all the squads that are registered on the system. Similar to the player list screen in look and feel. As well as the ability to search through the list to find a specific squad. This screen allows for users to search for players based on the squad they are in. It will also allow for further functionality in the final application. The user will be able to enter the name or part of the name of the squad into the text box. Then by clicking the search button it will display the results below.

 
## Player Profile Screen

The player profile screen will show all the information on the selected player. With a lot of information to show to the user I decided to diverge from the top to bottom look of the rest of the application and split the application into to sections. The left section will focus on display all the information on the selected user while the right section will display the skills and skill functionality. It is very important for this screen in particular to support a font-size appropriate for an easy-to-read experience.

 
## Add Player Skill Screen

The add player skill screen will allow the user to add a skill to a player’s profile. Keeping the consistent look and feel of the rest of the program with the top to bottom flow. The user will have the ability to sort the list of skills if they desire. Then they will select the skill to be added to the player’s profile afterwards selecting the rating for the player. Until finally selecting the add skill button to update the player’s profile with the new skill. The user has the ability to sort the list of skill by selecting a category from the combo box then selecting the sort button. This will change the results in the skill combo box to skills that are from said category.

## Edit Player Skill Screen

The edit player skill screen will act very similarly to the add player skill screen. The difference is the selected skill to edit will already have its information presented in the fields. The user can change the skill, or the rating then select edit skill button to update the player’s profile. Just like the add player skill screen the edit player skill screen will also have the ability for the user to sort the list of skills.

## Dialog Boxes

An error dialog that will be displayed throughout the application when user input is required. The dialog will only be displayed if the user has not input any information into the required fields.

A success dialog box will be displayed when the user is preforming an action which is successful. This gives the user feedback, so they know the action is complete.
